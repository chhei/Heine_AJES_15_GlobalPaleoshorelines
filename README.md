# Heine_AJES_15_GlobalPaleoshorelines
A compilation of global paleoshorelines from the Golonka et al., 2005 and Smith et al., 1994 paleogeographic models.

We invite contibutions to improve this global compilation. Please use the issue tracker functionality to improve

## Files contained in this repository ##

1.  `*.gpml` files at top level: These are collations of paleoshoreline estimates in [GPlates](http://www.gplates.org)-compatible format.
2.  `Global_Paleoshorelines_[Golonka|Smith]`: These directories contain:
    1. `Global_Paleoshorelines_[Golonka|Smith].shp`: A shapefile containing all timesteps (same as the `*.gpml` file but you can load/alter it in QGIS/ArcGIS)
    2.   A subdirectory called `[Smith|Golonka]_Timesteps_geojson`: This contains a `*.geojson` file of each timestep and can be pre-viewed using GitHub's automatic rendering of geojson files
    3.   A subdirectory called `[Smith|Golonka]_Timesteps_shp`: This contains sets of Shapefiles for each timestep (same as the `*.geojson` ones).
